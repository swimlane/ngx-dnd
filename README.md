## Quick intro and examples

### Directives

`ngx-dnd` provides a base set of directives to enable drag-and-drop.  By default all children of a `ngxDroppable` element may be dragged and dropped.  Add the `ngxDraggable` to restrict drag-and-drop to the parent container.  In general prefer using the base directives to the help components introduced later.

```html
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 1</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 2</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 3</div>
</div>
```

Give multiple containers the same `dropZone` name to allow drag-and-drop between these containers.

```html
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable="example">
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 1a</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 2a</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 3a</div>
</div>
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable="example">
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 1b</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 2b</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 3b</div>
</div>
```

`ngxDraggable` items can be restricted to specific containers:

```html
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable="['example-target']">Item 1a</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable="['example-target']">Item 2a</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable="['example-target']">Item 3a</div>
</div>
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable="example-target">
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 1b</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 2b</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 3b</div>
</div>
```

### Components

`ngx-dnd` provides a set of helper components that encapsulates the directives mentioned and adds capability for data driven structures.  In general you should prefer directives to components.

```js
orderableLists = [
  [
    "Item 1a",
    "Item 2a",
    "Item 3a"
  ],
  [
    "Item 1b",
    "Item 2b",
    "Item 3b"
  ]
]
```

```html
<ngx-dnd-container
  [model]="orderableLists">
</ngx-dnd-container>
```

This component is effectively equivalent to:

```html
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable [model]="orderableLists">
  <div
    class="ngx-dnd-item"
    ngxDraggable
    *ngFor="let item of orderableLists">{{item}}</div>
</div>
```

Including nested containers:

```html
<ngx-dnd-container
  [model]="nestedLists">
</ngx-dnd-container>
```

```js
nestedLists = [
  {
    "label": "Item 1",
    "children": []
  },
  {
    "label": "Item 2",
    "children": [
      {
        "label": "Item 2a",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "label": "Item 2b",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "label": "Item 2c",
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "label": "Item 3",
    "children": [
      {
        "label": "Item 3a",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "label": "Item 3b",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "label": "Item 3c",
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Install
To use ngx-dnd in your project install it via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swimlane/ngx-dnd):

* `npm i @swimlane/ngx-dnd --save`
* Add `NgxDnDModule` to your application module
* If using directives you will need to BYO styles or include `@swimlane/ng-dnd/release/index.css`.

## Development

* `git clone git@github.com:swimlane/ngx-dnd.git`
* `cd ngx-dnd`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Browse to http://localhost:9999

## [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-dnd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

This project uses [heff/chg](https://github.com/heff/chg), a simple changelog/release history manager.  When contributing to this project please add change notes (manually or using the [heff/chg](https://github.com/heff/chg) cli) to the `## HEAD (Unreleased)` section.

## Release

This project uses [sindresorhus/np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np), a better `npm publish`.  To publish a new version to npm, first ensure all entries in the `## HEAD (Unreleased)` section of the changelog are appropriate, commit changes, and push changes to github (if not already done).  Then use `npm run np` to launch an interactive UI that will guide you through publishing a new version.  `sindresorhus/np` and `heff/chg` will perform various pre-publish checks, run tests, bump the version number, update the changelog, then publish to npm and push to github. 

<details>
  <summary>Manual process</summary>

* `rm -rf node_modules`
* `npm i`
* `npm test`
* update version in `package.json`
* Update CHANGELOG.md:
  * move entries in the `## HEAD (Unreleased)` section below the horizontal rule, under a new header with the version number.
  * ensure all entries are approprate.
  * Leave a single `* _(none)_` entry in the `## HEAD (Unreleased)` section.
* `git commit -am {VERSION NUMBER}`
* `git tag {VERSION NUMBER}`
* `git push --tags`
* `npm run package`
* `npm publish`

</details>
